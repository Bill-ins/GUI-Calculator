# GUI-Calculator
A Graphical User Interface Calculator made with JAVA FX. Here I also added some features to make it as real as possible as a real physical calculator. You should definitely check out my code once and help me by contributing to make it better

Additional Features :-

Added percentage operator. (%)

User can use the result to make further operations. (Example - 1+2 = 3+2 = 5.......)

Added multiple operation feature, which mean you can calculate with multiple numbers. (Example - 1+2+3+5-9.......)
